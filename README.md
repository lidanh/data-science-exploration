# Israel Government Data Exploration
This is an assignment in the data scientist course at BGU university.

In this assignment I'll explore vegetables and fruits prices, based on pricing dataset which provided by the **ministry of agriculture & rural development**.

The main idea is to gather data from this dataset (xls file), and show some basic insights about this data, such as basic graphs and correlations.

Work in progress, more info will be available soon.
