# Israel Government Data Exploration
This is an assignment in the data scientist course at BGU university.

In this assignment I'll analyze funnel data of a SaaS product which enables users to send payment requests and get paid online.

The main idea is to gather data from this dataset (csv file), and show some basic insights about this data, such as basic graphs and correlations.

Work in progress, more info will be available soon.

## Funnel Steps
1. Create payment request
2. Send payment request
3. User of user (aka consumer) pay online or offline
